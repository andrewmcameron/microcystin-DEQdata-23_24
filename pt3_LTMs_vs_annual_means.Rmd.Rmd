Merge Annual average values for 2023 and 2024 with previously derived long-term average values (LTMs).		

Note that this survey only includes a small subset of all the stations for which we have derived long-term average values.				
Note that this survey also includes new stations for which there are no long-term average values.		

Output: regressions of annual means vs. long-term means (e.g., CHLa23 and CHLa24 vs. CHLaLTM).	

Fields:
StationID	StationName	AdminRegion	Depth	CHLa23	TN23	TP23	CHLa24	TN24	TP24	CHLaLTM	TNLTM	TPLTM
